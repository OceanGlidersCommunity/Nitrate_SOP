Welcome to the “Nitrate - Standard Operating Practice (SOP)” room.

Session co-leads: Antony Birchill, Gerd Krahmann, Soeren Thomsen

If you have expertise on Nitrate measurements on gliders please feel free to contact us prior to the session

May 21 Friday 
	16:00 - 17:30 CEST / 7:00 - 8:30 PDT / 22:00 - 23:30 AWST
	Nitrate SOP: Reviewing of SOP (LINK TO DRAFT)

## Participants: 
Soeren Thomsen, Gerd Krahmann, Anthony Birchill, Tom Hull, Yumi Song, Alex Beaton, 

## Meeting notes: 
plan as for oxygen SOP is to move this document to an online document at some point
discussion on drift 
Alex Beaton is joining the effort
