# OceanGliders Nitrate SOP

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/Nitrate_SOP) is for the [OceanGliders](https://www.oceangliders.org) Nitrate Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).

Read the SOP [here](https://oceangliderscommunity.github.io/Nitrate_SOP/sections/authors_SOP_development_process.html). 

## Community review
The community review is planned to start in December 2021.
Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG-format-user-manual/pull/23) to ensure you follow the community rules.

### Who is invited to review?
Constructive feedback by anyone is welcome. We encourage both experts and new gliders users who want to start observing nitrate to feedback on the document. For example: Experts are welcome to critically assess the specific methods and uncertainty ranges outlined in the SOP. New users can help to improve the SOP by providing a feedback from the user perspective. 

### How to contribute
See contributer guideline [here](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/Nitrate_SOP/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Next steps
1) 4 months community review on GitHub starting in December 2021 until March 2022
2) Follow the requirements for the [GOOS](https://www.goosocean.org) endorsement process as outline in [Hermes 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.25607/OBP-926)
3) Submission to [Frontiers: Research Topic Best Practices in Ocean Observing](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7173/best-practices-in-ocean-observing) for peer-review April 2022
4) Depositing of major SOP releases at the [Ocean Best Practice System (OBPS)](https://www.oceanbestpractices.org)

The main SOP document will always reside in this GitHub repository to allow updates within the OceanGliders community at any time. After major revisions regular peer-reviewed updates are planned.
