## Nitrate sensors

### UV Spectrometers
To our knowledge there are currently at least two different instruments for UV spectroscopy Nitrate measurements in seawater, one manufactured by Sea-Bird Scientific (USA) called Deep SUNA and one by TriOS (Germany) called OPUS. 
A similar instrument has been developed in China (Zhu et al., 2021) but is not yet commercially available.
Deep SUNAs have been specially developed for use on gliders and Argo floats and have been in use now for several years with good experiences. 
OPUS instruments have been tested on floats within the Euro-Argo project (https://www.euro-argo.eu/) but not yet on gliders. 
Both instruments have a 10 mm sample path length in common as this appears to be optimal for the used light sources and spectral sensors and the Nitrate concentrations expected in seawater.
Apart from these instruments there exists a larger number of submersible Nitrate sensors that are optimized for use in freshwater lakes and rivers or for monitoring wastewater (e.g. by YSI, see https://www.ysi.com/parameters/nitrate; by Xylem, see https://www.xylemanalytics.com/en/products/listing-wtw-process-all). 
Whether these could be modified for use in seawater and on gliders is not known.
