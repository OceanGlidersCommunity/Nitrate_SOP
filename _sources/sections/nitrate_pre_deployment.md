# Pre-deployment operations and calibrations

## Storage and Maintenance

### UV Spectrometers
The described UV sensors have no special storage needs apart from that typical for high sensitivity optical instruments. Follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions in the instrument manuals. 

Regular monitoring of the UV lamp usage is important for Deep SUNA instruments. 
The advertised lifetime of 900 h translates to more than 5 weeks of continuous operation at the fastest sampling rate of 1 Hz or nearly 30 weeks of operation at a reduced sampling rate of 5.5 seconds. 
At GEOMAR one Deep SUNA was in use for 7 two to three week long deployments before a lamp replacement and servicing was initiated.  

### Lab-on-Chip Instruments
Similarly, the LoC analysers have limited storage requirements (room temperature, clean and dry is sufficient).
Reagents have also been shown to be remarkably stable, year long deployments have been conducted in the marine environment and replacement reagents can be purchased. 
For long term storage (several weeks and more), it is recommended to remove the cadmium reduction tube (accessible outside the housing) and store as per manufacturer instructions (so that it cannot dry out and risk becoming blocked).

## Generic function test
### UV Spectrometers
Before deployment a full function test of the UV spectrometer in the lab is recommended. 

A running self-registering instrument should be immersed into water samples with different nitrate concentrations.
E.g. into distilled water (or low nutrient surface water) and, if available, into a sample from a deeper water mass which is known to contain nitrate. 
The instruments have to be able to detect the difference and, if calibrated,  should give good values and, if not calibrated, should at least detect a difference of the correct order of magnitude.
